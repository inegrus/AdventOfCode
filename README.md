# Advent Of Code 2017

This year I will use an "Advent of Code" Calendar to count the number of days until Christmas. 
In this way, I will learn more about Python programming language and I will improve my solving problems skills also I am exicited to see what "image" I will create at the finish of the puzzle.

Many thanks Eric Wastl for the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/"> puzzle</a>!
